Project Description

Tkinter Two-Step Verification

This project implements a simple yet effective two-step verification system using Python and Tkinter. It utilizes the pyotp library to handle Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTPs), providing an added layer of security for user authentication.
Key Features

    TOTP Generation and Verification: Leverages pyotp to create a secure, time-sensitive OTP, checked against the user's input for authentication.
    Tkinter GUI: Features a straightforward graphical user interface that allows users to input their verification code.
    Security Practices: Demonstrates fundamental security practices using TOTP, ideal for educational purposes or as a starting point for more advanced systems.

Getting Started

Ensure you have Python installed on your system, and install the pyotp library via pip to get started:
pip install pyotp

How to Use

    Download the Project: Clone this repository or download the source code to your local machine.
    Run the Application: Navigate to the directory containing the script and run:

    bash

    python tkinter.py

Launching the script will open the GUI where you can test the TOTP entry.
Example Usage

Invoke the setup_gui() function within your Python environment to start the GUI and interact with the verification process. This provides a hands-on experience with two-factor authentication.

This project is designed for those new to security practices as well as for developers looking to implement or understand two-factor authentication mechanisms in their applications
